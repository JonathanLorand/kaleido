My friend M. W. said that if there was a BBQ event whose explicit advertised purpose was for people to make new friends, then we probably wouldn't go. But if there was a BBQ hosted by a friend, he might go there with the hopes of making some new friends. 

I want to make a note about some of the dynamics, subtlties, paradoxes, weirdnesses around taking direct or indirect approaches to a topic or intention, explicit or implicit communication, and related phenomena...
