"'We do not know each other yet' wrote to me one whom I hold dear above all others, 'we have not yet dared to be silent together.'"

Here an excerpt from the essay "Silence", by Maurice Maeterlinck, from which the above quote stems: 

>"But the real silence, which is greater still and more difficult of appraoch than the material silence of which Carlyle speaks-- the real silence is not one of those gods that can desert mankind. It surrounds us on every side; it is the source of the undercurrents of our life; and let one of us but knock, with trembling fingers, at the door of the abyss, it is always by the same attentive silence that this door will be opened. 
>
>  <br>
>  
>It is a thing that knows no limit, and before it all men are equal; and the silence of king and slave, in the presence of death, or grief, or love, reveals the same features, hides beneath its impenetrable mantle the self-same treasure. For this is the essential silence of our soul, our most inviolable sanctuary, and its secret can never be lost; [...]  
>  
>  <br>
>  
>No sooner are the lips still than the sould awakens, and sets forth on its labours; for silence is an element that is full of surprise, danger and happiness, and in these the soul possesses itself in freedom. If it be indeed your desire to give yourself over to another, be silent; and if you fear being silent with him-- unless this fear be the proud uncertainty, or hunger, of the love that yearns for prodigies-- fly from him, for your soul knows well how far it may go. [...]

>'We do not know each other yet' wrote to me one whom I hold dear above all others, 'we have not yet dared to be silent together.' And it was true: already did we love each other so deeply that we shrank from the superhuman ordeal. And each time that silence fell upon us-- the angel of the supreme truth, the messenager that brings to the heart the tidings of the unknown-- each time did we feel that our souls were craving mercy on their knees, were begging for a few hours more of innocent falsehood, a few hours of ignorance, a few hours of childhood. ... And none the less must its hour come. It is the sun of love, and it ripens the fruit of the soul, as the sun of heaven ripens the fruits of the earth. But it is not without cause that men fear it; for none can ever tell what will be the *quality* of the silence which is about to fall upon them. Though all words may be akin, every silence differs from its fellow; and, with rare exceptions, it is an entire destiny that will be govered by the *quality* of this first silence which is descending upon two souls. [...] The result can never be foretold; all this comes to pass in a heaven that never warns; and therefore it is that the tenderest of lovers will often defer to the last hour of all the solemn entry of the great revealer of the depths of our being...

>[...] If I tell some one that I love him-- as I may have told a hundred others-- my own words will convey nothing to him; but the silence which will ensue, if I do indeed love him, will make clear in what depths lie the roots of my love, and will in its turn give birth to a conviction, that shall itself be silent; and in the course of a lifetime, this silence and this conviction will never again be the same...

>Is it not silence that determines and fixes the savour of love? Deprived of it, love would lose its eternal essence and perfume. Who has not known those silent moments which separated the lips to reunite the souls? It is these that we mus ever seek. There is no silence more docile than the silence of love, and it is indeed the only one that we may claim for ouselves alone. The other great silences, those of death, grief, or destiny, do not belong to us. They come towards us at their own hour, following in the track of events, and those whom they do not meet need not reproach themselves. But we can all go forth to meet the silences of love.

#### Notes

Some aspects of silence for me:

- opens up certain spaces of perception for me, certain kinds of awareness
- can be quite relaxing when in it
- deaccelerating
	
Some possible effects of silence in a group:
- deaccelerating
- equalizing
- connecting

WORSHIP SHARING

In a short mini-workshop that I participated in, Jane Huber-Davies, who is a Quaker, led us through a format known to her community as "Worhsip Sharing". It seemed that the key ingredient was silence. The session was also named "Gespraech aus der Stille". 

The session began with some minutes of silence together (what a transformation of the interpersonal space and one's one state of being). Then she spoke a text which was a prompt to reflect on and subsequently for us to share in the group what came up inside of us. The sharing was explicitly directed to be in a form which is not a responding to what other people say in the direct sense. There was also the instruction to leave a little bit of silence before speaking after someone else had shared. Finally, she judged at some point the sharing to be finished, and we closed with some minutes of silence. All three/four uses of silence - the transition silence in the beginning, the small silence spaces in between people sharing, the transition silence at the end, as well as a certain overall background "[[quietude]]" that was created - seemed each very valuable and 'right' and played an important role I felt. 

In the short discussion which happened later after trying out the method, she made this comment: "Silence is equalizing". 

GROUNDWERK

During the groundwerk workshop, there were also generous amounts of silence and 'being quiet together'. It felt very intimate and slightly holy. The format of the "resonance space" that was used at the end of each of the three workshop days seems to have many similarities with the quaker Worship Sharing format. One difference seems to be that in the resonance space, there was an element of 'association' and 'responding without discursivity' that was mentioned perhaps as an instruction/description and also did happen in the sessions. It had some vibes of a jam and a flow. There was slowness, silence, and spacings, but there also grew a rhythm and motion.
