The following seem to be aspects of silence for me:
- I often feel an initial resistance to entering into it
- opens up certain spaces of perception for me, certain kinds of awareness
- can be quite relaxing when in it
- deaccelerating
	
The following seem to be possible effects of silence in a group:
- deaccelerating
- equalizing
- connecting
- awkward, nervous-making, uncomfortable
- relaxing, comfortable

WORSHIP SHARING

In a short mini-workshop that I participated in, Jane Huber-Davies, who is a Quaker, led us through a format known to her community as "Worhsip Sharing". It seemed that the key ingredient was silence. The session was also named "Gespraech aus der Stille". 

The session began with some minutes of silence together (what a transformation of the interpersonal space and one's one state of being). Then she spoke a text which was a prompt to reflect on and subsequently for us to share in the group what came up inside of us. The sharing was explicitly directed to be in a form which is not a responding to what other people say in the direct sense. There was also the instruction to leave a little bit of silence before speaking after someone else had shared. Finally, she judged at some point the sharing to be finished, and we closed with some minutes of silence. All three/four uses of silence - the transition silence in the beginning, the small silence spaces in between people sharing, the transition silence at the end, as well as a certain overall background "[[quietude]]" that was created - seemed each very valuable and 'right' and played an important role I felt. 

In the short discussion which happened later after trying out the method, she made this comment: "Silence is equalizing". 

GROUNDWERK

During the groundwerk workshop, there were also generous amounts of silence and 'being quiet together'. It felt very intimate and slightly holy. The format of the "resonance space" that was used at the end of each of the three workshop days seems to have many similarities with the quaker Worship Sharing format. One difference seems to be that in the resonance space, there was an element of 'association' and 'responding without discursivity' that was mentioned perhaps as an instruction/description and also did happen in the sessions. It had some vibes of a jam and a flow. There was slowness, silence, and spacings, but there also grew a rhythm and motion.
