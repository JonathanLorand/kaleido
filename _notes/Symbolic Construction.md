Humans can make << machines >> out of symbols -- written marks (or other forms of signification) that we ourselves invent. Symbols which we give meaning to, for which we develop grammar, logic, semantics, and which can take on a certain life of their own. This is magical and extremely powerful. Natural language involves symbolic construction. Mathematics involves symbolic construction. Mythological systems involve symbolic construction. Symbolic construction makes systems of [[Cognitive Artifacts]]. Semiotic cognitive ecologies? Ha.

#### Notes

The term "symbolic construction" is, to my knowledge, due to Hermann Weyl.
