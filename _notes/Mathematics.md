#### Notes

“What is Math?

Math, like recipes, has both ingredients and method. And just as a recipe would be a bit useless if it omitted the method, we can’t understand what math is unless we talk about the way it is done, not just the things it studies. Incidentally the method in the above recipe is quite important—these don’t cook very well in a large tray. In math the method is perhaps even more important than the ingredients. Math probably isn’t whatever you studied in high school in classes called “math.” Yet somehow I always knew that math was more than what we did in high school. So what is math?

Recipe Books
What If We Organized Recipes by Equipment?

Cooking often proceeds a bit like this: you decide what you want to cook, you buy the ingredients, and then you cook it. Sometimes it might work the other way round: you go wandering through the store or maybe a market, you see what ingredients look good, and you feel inspired by them to conjure up your meal. Perhaps there’s some particularly fresh fish, or a type of mushroom you’ve never seen before, so you buy it and go home and look up what to do with it afterwards.

Occasionally something completely different happens: you buy a new piece of equipment, and suddenly you want to try making all sorts of different things with that equipment. Perhaps you bought a blender, and suddenly you make soup, smoothies, ice cream. You try making mashed potatoes in it, and it goes horribly wrong (it looks like glue). Maybe you bought a slow cooker. Or a steamer. Or a rice cooker. Perhaps you learn a new technique, like separating eggs or clarifying butter, and suddenly you want to make as many things as possible involving your new technique.

So we might approach cooking in two ways, and one seems much more practical than the other. Most recipe books are divided up according to parts of the meal rather than by techniques. There’s a chapter on appetizers, a chapter on soup, a chapter on fish, a chapter on meat, a chapter on dessert, and so on. There might be a whole chapter on an ingredient—say, a chapter on chocolate recipes or vegetable recipes. Sometimes there are whole chapters on particular meals—say, a chapter on Christmas dinner. But it would be quite odd to have a chapter on “recipes that use a rubber spatula” or “recipes that use a balloon whisk.” Having said that, kitchen gadgets often come with useful booklets of recipes you can make with your new equipment. A blender will come with blender recipes; likewise a slow cooker or an ice cream maker. Something similar is true of subjects of research. Usually when you say what a subject is, you describe it according to the thing that you’re studying. Maybe you study birds, or plants, or food, or cooking, or how to cut hair, or what happened in the past, or how society works. Once you’ve decided what you’re going to study, you learn the techniques for studying it, or you invent new techniques for studying it, just as you learn how to whisk egg whites or clarify butter. In math, however, the things we study are also determined by the techniques we use. This is similar to buying a blender and then going round seeing what you can make with it. This is more or less backwards compared with other subjects. Usually the techniques we use are determined by the things we’re studying; usually we decide what we want for dinner and then get out the equipment for making it. But when we’re really excited about our new blender, we try to make all our dinners with it for a while. (At least I’ve seen people do this.)

It’s a bit of a chicken-and-egg question, but I am going to argue that math is defined by the techniques it uses to study things, and that the things it studies are determined by those techniques.

Cubism
When the Style Affects the Choice of Content

Characterizing math by the techniques it uses is similar to defining styles of art, like cubism or pointillism or impressionism, where the genre is defined by the techniques rather than by the subject matter. Or ballet and opera, where the art form is defined by the methods and the subject matter is duly restricted. Ballet is very powerful at expressing emotion but not so good at expressing dialogue or making demands for political change. Cubism is not that effective for depicting insects. Symphonies are good at expressing tragedy and joy but not very good at saying “Please pass the salt.”
In math the technique we use is logic. We only want to use sheer logical reasoning. Not experiments, not physical evidence, not blind faith or hope or democracy or violence. Just logic. So what are the things we study? We study anything that obeys the rules of logic.

>Mathematics is the study of anything that obeys the rules of logic, using the rules of logic.

I will admit immediately that this is a somewhat simplistic definition. But I hope that after reading some more you’ll see why this is accurate as far as it goes, not as circular as it sounds at first, and just the sort of thing a category theorist would say.

The Prime Minister
Characterizing Something by What It Does

Imagine if someone asked you “Who’s the prime minister?” and you answered “He’s the head of the government.” This would be correct but annoying, and not really answering the right question: you’ve characterized the prime minister without telling us who it is. Likewise, my “definition” of mathematics has characterized math rather than telling you what it is. This is a little unhelpful, or at least incomplete—but it’s just the start.
Instead of describing what math is like, can we say what math is? What does math actually study? It definitely studies numbers, but also other things like shapes, graphs, and patterns, and then things that you can’t see—logical ideas. And more than that: things we don’t even know about yet. One of the reasons math keeps growing is that once you have a technique, you can always find more things to study with it, and then you can find “more techniques to use to study those things, and then you can find more things to study with the new techniques, and so on, a bit like chickens laying eggs that hatch chickens that lay eggs that hatch chickens...

Mountains
Conquering One Enables You to See the Higher Ones

Do you know that feeling of climbing to the top of a hill, only to find that you can now see all the higher hills beyond it? Math is like that too. The more it progresses, the more things it comes up with to study. There are, broadly, two ways this can happen.

First, there’s the process of abstraction. We work out how to think logically about something that logic otherwise couldn’t handle. For example, you previously only made rice in your rice cooker, and then you work out that you can use it to make cake, it’s just a bit different from cake made the normal way in an oven. We take something that wasn’t really math before, and look at it differently to turn it into math. This is the reason that x’s and y’s start appearing—we start by thinking about numbers, but then realize that the things we do with numbers can be done to other things as well. This will be the subject of the next chapter.

Secondly, there’s the process of generalization: we work out how to build more complicated things out of the things we’ve already understood. This is like making a cake in your blender, and making the frosting in your blender, and then piling it all up.† In math this is how we get things like polynomials and matrices, complicated shapes, four-dimensional space, and so on, out of simpler things like numbers, triangles, and our everyday world. We’ll look into this in Chapter 5.
These two processes, abstraction and generalization, will be the subject of the next few chapters, but first I want to draw your attention to something weird and wonderful about how math does these two things.

I think quite a bit of chapter 8, "What mathematics is", in "How to Bake Pi" is also quite rich / illuminating / helpful. Maybe include some parts from there?
