What comes to mind when I think of this word? 
- reading in the same room or space as other people, or doing some other quiet activities in parallel
	- the other people might be strangers or not
		- imagine a nicely lit cabin in a train traveling in the night
- the effect of being in a warm, dry, nicely lit place indoors when outside the weather is cold, wet, vastely dark, or harsh in some way
- snuggling with a person that I feel comfortable with, or being sleepy in a pleasurable way in trusted company
