## Textkonzept - MTR text assignment

### Structure

My text will be a two-layered hypertext.

By 'hypertext', I mean that the text will be divided into modular pieces (let's call them chapters) which need not be read in a fixed linear order. Furthermore, each of the chapters will contain hyperlinks (analogous to the ones we know from the internet) to other chapters.

By 'two-layered', I mean that each chapter will have two types of text: besides the fuller 'body' of text of the chapter, there will also be a short 'header' text written in a compact manner which aims to summarize the essence of that chapter. In this manner, a reader who wishes to capture the gist of the full text in a short amount of time may read only the header texts of all the chapters. This idea is inspired by the structure of [Ref: 1.] and [Ref: 2.].  

### Medium

The text will be written digitally, and also a physical printing will be made.
In the digital version, the hyperlinks will be working links; in the physical version, the hyperlinks will be indicated syntactically.  

### Content

Topics covered in this text are ones related to my [[AgoraGarden/MTR]] project, "Utopoi". 
I see this text assignment as an opportunity to

* "think through writing";
* produce materials that I can perhaps use later, for my project and for the master's thesis text;
* experiment with the text format and production process.
