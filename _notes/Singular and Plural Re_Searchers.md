title: Singular and Plural Re_Searchers
---


The title of this note is inspired from some words/ideas that Dieter Mersh was using. Namely he was speaking of artists as "singular (re)searchers" (or something along these lines), while discussing what the term "research" might mean in the context of the arts. 

I understood his use of "singular" as something that is juxtaposed with the "universal" connotation of objectivity in science, and referring to the personal, individual, subjective experience that can be conceived as part of the tools/craft/methodology of artistic (re)searching. 

I also like the use of "(re)search" - the 'searching' component connotates for me a dimension of personal desire/curiosity/urgency. And it conjures an image of a large rich landscape that is being explored. There is a question that is burning, and it will only be answered when the artist themselves arrives at the locus of the answer and experiences it first-hand. 

The title of this note means to play with the "singular" by adding a "plural" - in order to imaging the above processes not as enclosed in the solitary voyage of a single artist, but as something that can be a *shared* singularity, a shared (unique) process of (re)searching.
