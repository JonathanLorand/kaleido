A certain spirit of the speculative, imaginative, optimistic and idealistic which is brought into the now. Lived -- and acted from -- in the present. Use it! To try things out; to explore, use, and test in the dirtyness of the everyday. Utopia, not as a place, but as a method or an attitude or a feeling. Utopia as a substance: spread it on your sandwich, spray it from a can, stick things together with it.
