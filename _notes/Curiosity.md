It seems to be a basic characteristic which is part of human behavior. Hmm. 

What ignites and encourages curiosity? 
To what extend can it be "willfully turned on"?
What kinds of alterior motives inside me might be behind the curiosities that I feel? 
What curiositities *do* I feel, anyway?

In the "meaningful conversations" workshop it was mentioned several times by several people that curiousity was a key ingredient for meaningful converstaions. Someone also said that respect can follow from curiosity.
