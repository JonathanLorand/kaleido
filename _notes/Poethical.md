I like the ring of this word. 
I'm not sure what range of meanings others understand by it. At a first approximation, I understand it to be a fusion of poesis and ethics. What might this look like?

I first encountered this word, I think, via [Denise Ferreira da Silva](https://grsj.arts.ubc.ca/person/denise-ferreira-da-silva/) and [Valentina Desideri](https://www.google.com/search?q=valentina+desideri&client=firefox-b-d&hl=en&sxsrf=ALeKk00To1dJ8504uoaaV0ww8EjTLD5V7g:1618561605149&ei=RUp5YIHKCMyTkwXI07jYAQ&start=0&sa=N&ved=2ahUKEwjBgJbsq4LwAhXMyaQKHcgpDhs4ChDx0wN6BAgBEDU&biw=1388&bih=786), who do "poethical readings" (e.g. involving tarot). When I websearch the word, I get the impression that the term might be have been invented by [Joan Retallack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Retallack).
