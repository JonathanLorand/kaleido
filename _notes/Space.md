The term "space" contains many ideas, spans many contexts. It is broad and open. 

Here is list of some flavors of "space" that come to my mind.
- space 0: abstract mathematical
	- Mathematicians love the word "space". It is used widely and loosely. Often it is used in phrases of the form "the space of all X". In this case it is used when a collection of mathematical enitites (X) are at play which all belong together in some sense or another. Here "space" is essentially synonmous with "set". I feel like there is a difference in connotation and perspective, though. In some sense we are thinking of this set as "spread out" in space, as explorable, as having some implicit notion of distance, or extension, or relative position.
	- Example: [[Human State Space]] = the space of all possible states that a human might find themselves in. 
	- I've decided to place this aspect of the word "space" first in this list, since I think it flavors the way I think of space in all other contexts. I think there are other dimensions to the word space than captures in this short mathematical part; however this reduced abstract conception of "space" is a fundamental one for me. 
- space 1: sensory
	- In one sense, I can think of sensory spaces in terms of the mathematical conception described above: for example, "aural space" might mean the space (the "set") of all possible aural experiences I (or anyone?) I can imagine. It is indeed not only a set, since there is a (or several?) inutuitive notions of distance/closeness in this "space". It is parametrized by such "dimensions" as amplitude/loudness, pitch, timbre and types of tones, etc.  
	- The "mathematical" notion of space though feels to me like a "bird's eye" or "outside" view of a space: one has an overview of the totality of possibilities in the space, or one is at least somehow conceptually embracing the full space. The word "sensory" however also conjures for me the image of navigation a landscape *using* my senses, with a focus on what is experienceable, what is within reach; the space of what I currently can consciously percieve. This sense of "sensory space" has a phenomenological flavor, and it has an aspect which is also internal to me. Here there seems to be overlap with "space 6" below. 
- space 2: physical and geometric
	- This is similar to "space 1" in that ...
- space 3: interpersonal
- space 4: societal, cultural
- space 5: scene, techne, topical
- space 6: cognitive, imaginatory, emotional, psychological
