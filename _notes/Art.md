#### Notes


Art as a form of language(s) for communicating experience
	- as opposed to the narrower cognitive scope of natural language, this is much broader in scope, much looser in it "grammar", and has often many localized dialects understood only by a few people (sometimes just the artist themselves) 
- as a practice of generating new forms of experience
- there is some sort of feeback loop between the first two points
- sender-medium-reciever model and social aspects of language still apply
