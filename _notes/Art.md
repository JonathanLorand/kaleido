Art as the *communication* of experiences and as the *exporation/generation* of experiences. 

The aspect of communication, can, for example, be thought in terms of the simple, three-part model described in the note on [[Communication]]. The three roles of "sender, medium, receiver" described there, might, in the context of art, be renamed "artist, medium, audience". 

I find it fun to consider various special cases. For example, the case where the the roles of the artist and the audience (the sender and the reciever) are played by one and the same person. Let's say that person is me. What might it mean to be the artist and audience at once? It might mean producing or exploring some new performative experience for my own enrichment. Or it might mean deciding to look at something in the world with the eye of an artist: seeing the "art" in something that I am looking at is an artistic act in itself. And it is in some sense collapsed together with the act of "recieving" a piece of art. 

The aspect of exploring or generating experiences seems to me connected with the idea of artists as "researchers", as mentioned in [[Singular and Plural Re_Searchers]]. 

An observation that comes to mind is that in art, there is both an interest in *new* experiences as well as in taking a new, closer (or richer?) look at common, everyday experiences.

#### Notes


Art as a form of language(s) for communicating experience
	- as opposed to the narrower cognitive scope of natural language, this is much broader in scope, much looser in it "grammar", and has often many localized dialects understood only by a few people (sometimes just the artist themselves) 
- as a practice of generating new forms of experience
- there is some sort of feeback loop between the first two points
- sender-medium-reciever model and social aspects of language still apply 


The exploration/generation distinction, or "duality", seems tightly analogous with the debate about whether mathematical entities are discovered or invented.
