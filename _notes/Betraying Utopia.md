>Part 1. Betraying Utopia  
The first part is about how betrayal can be used as a tool to corrupt, to shred utopia, about how time haunts utopia, and the difference between chimeras and monsters.


>A utopia is a suspended locale, a space without time, extracted out of the mud of life. This canonical, western acceptance, is a suspicious object of desire - dis-incarnated; bodies are designed, pacified, or idealized. It is an island where time is suspended, and thus transformation is excluded. What happens when we re-introduce time, when we betray Utopia’s intent?  
 
>To unlearn what “Utopia” could be/become, Jassem Hindi is using historical, conceptual and speculative strategies. This audio narrative consists of two parts, it is a soft introduction to wide research on “Betraying” utopia, and on “Slimy” utopia. This means using utopia as a political practice that is not about projection (waiting patiently for the future) in a linear, progressive timeline (what is possible according to what we know) - our strategy is to fragment utopia into smaller pieces and disseminate those fragments in our present practices. In art, Utopia is not ‘yet to come', it is a now: a poem written in times of war is direct access to utopia, a pharmakon in times of hardship - that is the effectiveness of utopia, its potential for immanence, for betraying the dis-incarnated, idealist version.
