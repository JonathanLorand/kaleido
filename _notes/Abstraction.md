“Abstract Mathematics

Abstraction is the key to understanding what mathematics is. Abstraction is also at the heart of why mathematics can seem removed from “real life.” That detachment from reality is where math derives its strength, but also its limitations. Every level of abstraction takes it further from real life, and harder to explain what the relevance to real life is, because the relevance comes from a domino effect—abstract mathematics might not be directly applicable to real life, but rather, applicable to something else which is applicable to real life, or via an even longer chain of applications, for example:


Abstraction is the key to understanding why mathematics is different from science at large. Evidence-based science proceeds with, obviously, evidence at its heart. You start with a hypothesis—something you believe might be true, whether because of general observation, gut feeling, suspicion, anecdotes, or whatever. Now you need to test the hypothesis rigorously by finding evidence that holds up to scientific standards. Such standards include things like these:
•You must have a large enough sample size. Three or four cases is anecdotal and could have been a fluke.
•The evidence must be controlled. You must be sure that you[…]”

“How Does Logic Work?

A logical argument is a series of statements, each of which follows from the previous one using only logic. That’s all very well, but where does it start? You always have to start with a basic set of assumptions. For example, you might assume your cake is perfectly circular. You might assume that an infectious disease has a 50 percent chance of being passed from one person to another if they meet. These basic assumptions are part of the process of abstraction. They usually involve turning your real-life objects into something theoretical, so that you can reason with them using logic. The downside is that your theoretical situation won’t be exactly the same as your real one. But the upside is that you will now be able to apply logical process to work things out about them. The inaccuracy of your final answer will now come from the information you threw away when you performed the initial abstraction. This is very different from statistical results, where the inaccuracy of the final answer comes from a small possibility that your hypothesis was wrong despite the evidence.
The mathematical method (as opposed to the more talked[…]”
