#### Notes

“Abstract Mathematics

Abstraction is the key to understanding what mathematics is. Abstraction is also at the heart of why mathematics can seem removed from “real life.” That detachment from reality is where math derives its strength, but also its limitations. Every level of abstraction takes it further from real life, and harder to explain what the relevance to real life is, because the relevance comes from a domino effect—abstract mathematics might not be directly applicable to real life, but rather, applicable to something else which is applicable to real life, or via an even longer chain of applications, for example:

> Category Theory --> Topology --> Physics --> Chemistry --> Medicine

Abstraction is the key to understanding why mathematics is different from science at large. Evidence-based science proceeds with, obviously, evidence at its heart. You start with a hypothesis—something you believe might be true, whether because of general observation, gut feeling, suspicion, anecdotes, or whatever. Now you need to test the hypothesis rigorously by finding evidence that holds up to scientific standards. Such standards include things like these:
- You must have a large enough sample size. Three or four cases is anecdotal and could have been a fluke.
- The evidence must be controlled. You must be sure that you have accounted for other factors that might have affected the evidence, such as the placebo effect, socioeconomic factors, the ages of people involved, and so on.
- The evidence must be unbiased. For example, drug tests must be double blind—neither the person taking the drug nor the person administering it can know whether it’s a real drug or placebo.

In the end, the result is statistical. You come up with a large body of very convincing evidence, but your conclusion always has a percentage certainty attached to it.

Mathematics is different. The first step is the same—you start with a hypothesis that you think might be true for some reason. But instead of testing it rigorously using evidence, you test it rigorously using logic. The meaning of “rigor” is now completely different. It has nothing to do with sample sizes, because you don’t ever use any samples—you only use thought processes. Bias doesn’t come into it either, because all you’re doing is applying logic.

For example, to find out how much frosting you need to cover a cake, you could do it experimentally—you could get a cake, frost it, and see how much you used. Or you could do it logically—you could do a calculation involving the surface area of a cake. To do this calculation you have to make an approximation of the shape of a cake. Perhaps you assume it’s perfectly round and perfectly flat on top. Of course, no cake is ever perfectly circular and flat. But the advantage of this method is that you don’t have to make any frosting in order to find out how much frosting you need.”

“How Does Logic Work?

A logical argument is a series of statements, each of which follows from the previous one using only logic. That’s all very well, but where does it start? You always have to start with a basic set of assumptions. For example, you might assume your cake is perfectly circular. You might assume that an infectious disease has a 50 percent chance of being passed from one person to another if they meet. These basic assumptions are part of the process of abstraction. They usually involve turning your real-life objects into something theoretical, so that you can reason with them using logic. The downside is that your theoretical situation won’t be exactly the same as your real one. But the upside is that you will now be able to apply logical process to work things out about them. The inaccuracy of your final answer will now come from the information you threw away when you performed the initial abstraction. This is very different from statistical results, where the inaccuracy of the final answer comes from a small possibility that your hypothesis was wrong despite the evidence.

The mathematical method (as opposed to the more talked-about scientific method) involves making very clear what your assumptions are. People can then disagree with your assumptions, but they aren’t entitled to disagree with your overall conclusion, which is:

*If* we make these assumptions, *then* this conclusion is true.

For example: if one chicken can feed ten people, then two chickens can feed twenty people. You can argue about how many people one chicken can really feed (probably not ten people unless it’s a scary genetically modified giant chicken), but you can’t argue with the fact that:

If one chicken feeds ten people, then two chickens feed twenty.

But there’s still a possible flaw here: are all the chickens the same size? We probably need to add an assumption saying “All chickens are about the same size” to ensure that the situation behaves mathematically.

Is this an unrealistic assumption? If you’re going to order whole roast chickens for a party with forty people, you’re probably going to do a calculation somewhat like this, even though chickens aren’t all exactly the same size. But on the other hand, you might proceed experimentally instead: you might rely on the experience of the caterer, who has probably held enough parties to have experimental evidence of how many chickens to get for forty people.

Abstraction can be difficult because it takes us out of the realm of physical objects and into the realm of “ideas” that we manipulate only in our head. But there are some abstract ideas we’re so used to that we don’t even notice how abstract they are any more. If we think about the size of an average chicken, that’s an abstraction right there: an “average chicken” isn’t a real chicken we’re considering, it’s just an idea of a chicken. As I mentioned before, numbers are abstract. The numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on are only ideas. Because they are ideas, we can manipulate them just using logic.

The wonderful thing about abstraction is that when you get very used to an abstract idea, it starts to feel like an actual object instead of just being a made-up idea. You’re probably quite comfortable with “2” as a concept. That means you’re comfortable with that level of abstraction. Perhaps you’re less comfortable with exactly what “−2” is. What about the square root of 2? It’s a number such that when you multiply it by itself, the answer is 2. But what actually is it? You might think it’s 1.414 . . . , but that is a decimal that goes on forever without recurring—you can’t write the whole thing down, so how do you know what it is? What about the square root of −1? We’ll investigate these questions in more depth later, and look at why rigorous mathematics has much more trouble with the square root of 2 than with −2 or even the square root of −1, even though intuitively the square root of −1 is much harder to think about because nothing like it ever appears in “real life.”

Part of the process of abstraction is like using your imagination. Mathematical abstraction takes us into an imaginary world where anything is possible as long as it’s not contradictory. Can you imagine transparent Lego blocks? That’s not so difficult, but what about squashy Lego blocks? That’s a bit more strange. What about Lego blocks that spontaneously change color when you touch them? Four-dimensional Lego blocks? Invisible Lego blocks? Lego blocks that can make coffee for you in the morning? Obviously in the real world, just because you can imagine something doesn’t mean it actually exists—particularly if you have a very vivid imagination. The amazing thing about the world of math is that mathematical things exist as soon as you imagine them. The more vivid your imagination, the more math you have access to.

Another abstract concept that we’re quite used to is shapes. What is a square? It’s a shape with four equal sides and four equal angles. But are there actually any perfect squares in the world? No, any physical shape in the real world is not going to be an absolutely microscopically pedantically perfect square. Likewise circles. What about straight lines? Are there really any perfectly straight lines? Not really. And yet we’re comfortable with the idea of a straight line, although the things in the real world are only approximations to this ideal.”
