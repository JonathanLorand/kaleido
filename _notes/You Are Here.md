Start with where you are. How are you feeling in this very moment?
[[Don't jump the first gate]]

It seems I often have a certain relunctance to look at "where I am". Maybe it feels like if I were to look, then I should do it in an open, frank, self-honestly way. And that might be scary, or unexpeted, to lead to me feeling obliged to take subsequent actions. Who know where it could lead. So maybe sometimes it feels easier not even to start the action of looking in the first place. 

Seeing what you have. And don't have. 
Using what you have. And don't have. 
Being grateful for what you have. And don't have. 
Accepting what you have. And don't have. 

Accepting and acknowledging negative emotions and statements. I am unhappy; I am in a crisis.
