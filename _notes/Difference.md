AUDRE LORDE

In her article/speech "The master's tools", Audrey Lorde speaks of using difference as a source of strength for a group of people. I am interested in going deeping with this thought... and understanding her thoughts about this further. 

ROBERTA LOCHER

In a conversation we had about harmony, she made the comment that perhaps "it is more harmonious to allow difference and dissonance". In this conversation she seemed to be making a distinction between dissonance and conflict.
