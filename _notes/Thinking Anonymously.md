We think differently in a group if our ideas, our comments, and our interactions are anonymous. 

I am interested in how this can shape group collaboration and communication, and how it can support "group intelligence". 

And also not necessarily in a group! One can think and communicate anonomously in a book, or on the internet, say. 

Might there also be ways to be (semi)anonymous in communication with oneself?
