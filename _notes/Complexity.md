One may make a distinction between problems/situations which are *complex* verses *complicated.*  

Let us use the term *complicated* to describe a problem or situation where there are many moving parts and many interdependencies between them, but where the relationships between the parts are in principle all understood, and thus can in principle be predicted and/or manipulated in a controlled and coherent way. For example, a computer system or an aeroplane are complicated systems, yet they are understood (usually) in all of their inner interdependecies: cause and effect between all of the components is understood, engineers have designed and created these objects, they can be repaired when broken, etc. Examples of complicated systems that are not human-engineered are for instance the sytstem of movements of the planets of the earth's solar system, or the behavior of electrical charge in various materials.  

A *complex* system, let us say, is one where we do not have an understanding, or only limited information, about causal relationships between components of the system, and it is, at present, not feasible to achieve such an understanding. 

The adjectives *complicated* and *complex* thus introduced seem to be relative to, or "dependent" on, the status of technical and conceptual knowledge present in the given context and time. For instance, for central europeans, the planetary motions became a *complicated* system after the discovery of theoretical notions such Keplar's laws and Newton's laws of gravitation. So, the planetary motions were, at one point, a "complex system", and at another point they satisfied the criteria for being a complicated system, once certain information and measurement technologies -- either in the technical sense or the conceptual sense of "technology"(i.e. "tools") -- had been developed. 

[I wonder how much this distinction also hinges on which notions of "understanding" and "knowledge" one is using, and one's perspective on "science". For instance, from the little I know, various ancient civilizations could make quite precise predictions about heavenly bodies. Unfortunately, I know very little about ancient astronomy, and here also arises the issue that conceptual landscapes are interwined contingent networks, so even the notion of "planet" in one historical epistemelogical context might not have a clear meaning in another. However, it does seem relatively clear that, in the scope, say, of comparing central european knowledge from the middle ages with that of the post-Newton era, there is a fundamental difference in the understanding of the motions of the planets.]


This situation raises the question of whether there is possibly a distinction between some systems which are "in principle" only "complicated" and not "complex", and other systems which are "essentially complex", i.e. they will remain complex no matter what knowledge and technology humans develop to try to understand them. 



/// 

The fact that the terms *complicated* and *complex* are only *relative* to a context implies that there might be "gray areas" in between the two terms. We might have a system which consists of so many components and interactions, that it is a challenge to track the information about the components and their behavior on the grounds that the task of collecting this information (in a time-span that is relevant) is not feasible, due to the *amount* of information that would be needed and also perhaps due to *measurement problems* (i.e. cases where there is a "measurement problem", i.e. where measurements themselves might disturb the system). It could also be that a complicated system seems complex because a proper theoretical understanding is lacking, but such an understanding is in principle possible.
