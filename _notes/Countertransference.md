#### Notes

A term I learned about from Roberta Locher. Picking up emotions from someone else through interaction. Seems like a neat term/phenomonon to expand on. 

See also [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countertransference)
(Seems original term focused on transference from a Psychotherapist)
