Thinking can be thought of broadly. 

What modes of "thinking" come to mind that go beyond the narrower senses of this term?

- Aspects of "thinking" that happens in and with the body
	- muscle memory 
		- piano, bike-riding, finding my lover's hands
	- intelligence of movement as a procss of thinking: movements experiment and build on themselves and combine themselves; they try, they find ways, they react and learn.
	- the feeback exchange between movement and cerebral cognition
	- cognition in the gut
		- so many cells of our nervous system are there... 
	- emotional intelligence, intuition, instinct.. a complex network of connections that "thinks"
	- the unsconscious processes in our brain that we don't see the workings of much

- Aesthetic thinking
	- non-language-based "operational" modes of constellational, linkage, montage, juxtaposition, self-reference, division and connection, composition and difference
	- showing instead of saying
	- media not only as carriers of information/communication, but as actors/agents in processes of aesthetic cognition
	- sensual and perceptual spheres as opposed to linguistic, discursive, propositional spheres
	- processes, maniplulations, statements in the space of aesthetic experience

- Mechanized thinking
	- Computation, algorithms, logical systems
		- This can happen both symbolically (mathematics) and physically (computers). These two layers are (magically!) intimately linked - this is what makes theoretical physics, and all the rest of science and technology, possible.  
	- Physical systems, like the solar system, compute or "think" in this sense one might say. The planets carry out a set of actions based on a set of rules. 

- Artifactual/emergent thinking
	- Entities  which are "non-self-conscious" and "without free will" (let's be a little flexible/loose here please) might be said to exhibit a sort of cognition. Such entities might be: inert objects, plants, some animals, and especially also collections/systems of such entities, or collections/systems of more general entities. 
		- For example, a group of people might exhibit a form of cognition which is emergent from the "system" that they form. Similarly, an arrangement of objects/beings/weather etc. might perform a kind of cognition which might overlap with "Aesthetic thinking" and "Mechanized thinking", but seems to me to include perhaps something which is also distinct to those two categories and contains something which might be inherent to the "logic" of their particular context. 
	- The roles played also by spaces and non-localized entities -- i.e. the wind or the air or an ocean -- seem interesting, too. 

It's also fun to think about the interactions between these modes of thinking, and all their hybrid forms. 

- Examples: 
	- Architecture, and more generally physical space, shaping aesthetic experience. 
		- Why else is it, for example, that the nice rooms for ballet dancers at the ZHdK have such high ceilings? It's not like they jump nearly that high!
	- Archtecture, and space generally, shaping human cerebral cognition. 
		- It certainly is a different feeling to think in a large, light library with a high ceiling, than to think in a small room in a basement (the latter can have advantages too, but the two experiences, cognitively, are simply different). Or to think with a far view across a landscape, or to think in the dark. 
	- Another beloved topic of course: the interactions between thinking and the physical tools we have for doing "thinking work". 
		- Our pencil/pens, our notebooks, our routines and methodologies, our hardwares and softwares.
