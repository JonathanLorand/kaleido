To make something into a "thing". To make it "real". 

Often this can happen by naming. A cloud of cognitive matter (i.e. a constellation of concepts, feelings, etc.) can get turned into an "entity" by giving it a name. And one is then able to more easily *operate on it* as an entity. 

Beyond the linguistico-logical maneuver of naming, reification also has dimensions that are not language-based, at least in the narrower sense of the word "language". *Externalization* of something from oneself seems to contribute to "reifying", and *social and contextual signification* seems to play a role as well. 

What are some examples along these lines? 

Well, for one, if someone else makes an observation about my behavior, then, even if I kind of thought the same thing already, the observed behavior obtains a new factuality and realness that it did not have before (maybe I thought before that there was a slight possibilty I was imagining things and fooling myself?). So this kind of example might have to do with certainty and objectivity, etc. But there are also cases where I know something that I am very very sure of (e.g. "I failed my exam"), and where the fact is initially only known to me, but then it takes on a new realness once it has been shared with other people. This reminds me of "witnesses" (e.g. at marriages or in criminal cases). Things can take on a different kind of "certainty" and "validity" once they have been externally witnessed.
