A branch of mathematics known for its abstractness and as a sort of synthesizing meta-language within mathematics. Abstraction gives it a breadth of applicability; it studies general patterns and structures. And it is full of beautiful ideas and perspectives. 

"Category theory brings context to the forefront."

#### Notes

I think I am attracted to it
- for being something that I find beautiful in its own right;
- as a language for understanding and formalizing patterns and analogies across mathematics, the sciences, engineering, ...
- because I find it interesting to study the interconnection and composition of (abstract) structures;
- because it gives an integrative framework which fosters conceptual clarity, principled design, interoperability, and the bridging of domains -- and I care about these things. 


Mention (?) 
 - Hegel connections 
 - Badiou
 - foundations
 - type theory
 - Rosetta stone...
