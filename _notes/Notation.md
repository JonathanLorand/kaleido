Notation is a form of [[Symbolic Construction]]. 

However, I associate the latter term with the topic of "language in the broad sense", and there it has some sort of emphasis on "computation". And there is, perhaps implicitly, the assumption of a sort of interlinking between an artificial, formal, symbolic system and some other non-symbolic system that it is synchronized with to some degree. Language, as a symbolic system, is interlinked with social and cognitive processes of humans. Mathematics, as a symbolic system, is interlinked with cognitive and physical processes of humans and nature. Mythological symbolic systems are interlinked with cognitive, social, and natural-physical processes. 

"Notation" is a bit of a lighter term I'd say, in that it's operational and systemic scope is smaller. Notation must signify, and ideally be suggestive and coherent, but it need not "compute" or be like a "theory" or a "full story". Perhaps "notation" is a "denotational system" (perhaps that's circular?), rather than an "operational structure" in the sense of a machine. Notation gives names and order, in the sense of tidyness, but not necessarily power. It is an intermediary between humans and their cognitive machines. A user interface.
