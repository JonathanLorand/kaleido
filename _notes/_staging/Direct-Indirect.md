For a moment some thoughts were in my mind about this topic... but they've sort of scuttled off... disturbed by my focus shifting to answer instant messages and be in practical, logistical thoughts... 

But I was feeling some pain and imagining myself in a room with people, them asking me "what do you want?"... and me breaking down in tears after a moment, saying "i just want to be loved"

and now i've crying as i write this and my body is trembling, shaky keyboard connection... but i'm still hitting the keys. 
and now calmer again.

yes, i just want to be loved. it's quite a clear, direct, simple feeling. well maybe not simple. but clear. 

and my problem/thought right now is that this isn't the easiest thing to just ask for. it has to grow, it has to have substance or history or specificity, it should to be given voluntarily, in the best case spontaneously and in moments when it is not necessarily expected or invited... right?
so i can't just ask a group of loose aquaintances or strangers for love, it seems. 

it's painful to think of their being this things that i feel so strongly thirsty for, hurting from... and i can't receive it in any short term way it can seem. 

and at the same time i feel there is a part about love that can be given right away, to a complete stranger too. and also to someone one knows, but didn't until now practive a feeling of love towards. love feels like an action, it feels like sometimes it is already so much there inside, wanting to be given to others... there is just a barrier of some sorts... or the others are not asking thirstily for it, so it would be so off to spray and flood them with my love... and  all the thought that then would come about what does this mean and what does he want and why.

other thought: the 'strategy' of being open and direct and honest 'didn't work' with mia... sharing so much, in the way i did, somehow didn't work... there was something not good about, that it is my judgement. maybe i interepret too much negatively, because of how things went and her reactions, maybe 'objectively' it was mostly good... but still, there is the feeling and the beleif that it is just not the best to be maximally open or sharing 'what is'... not trusting this as a strategy on its own... and afterall there is always selection of what one shares... and the 'how' of how one shares it... of course, there is yoram, and trusting the body and trusting authenticity... i do think this is great and powerful and constructive... but there are still questions for me about how to do in a way that is safe.. a way to do it when one isn't 100% able to do it all the time, consistenly and in a way that does actually 'serve'...

to save on this topic is also
- the convo snippet with mikhail about him "not wanting to go to a party where the stated purpose is to make friends"
	- and similarly: the turn off sometimes when a flyer for an event states very directly some things about connection, emotions, etc... i geuss the turn off happens when there is a sort of promise of something, but the hint/guess that maybe i won't feel connected or the organizers are also not sensitive to what else it going on (i.e. that there are these fears, that things might not speak to everyone, etc.) and this lack of awareness in itself maybe triggers unease... 
- the podcast episode of Ezra Klein where they talk about the 'status game' and how everyone is playing it all the time and that one is not allowed to admit/show that one is playing it while one is playing it... or, one can't really escape it even if one tries? this seesm like an interesting social structure... something one can't escape... feels almost like a mend-bending sculpture...
