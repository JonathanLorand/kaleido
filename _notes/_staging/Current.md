#### Notes

This note is about the topic -- or, perhaps i might say: the ideal intention or practice -- of staying "current" or "synced with the present time and conditions" or "updated"... 

I'm feeling and thinking this theme today as I try to pack up and clean out some of the things from my apartment, in preparation for probably moving. The activity of getting started with going through my stuff activates and affirms the budding feeling inside me that it really is time for a change of living situation... a fresh set of walls and windows, a fresh configuration of objects around me, fresh lines of sight in my everyday movements through space, a change of human relational scene and choreography. And in this context I am getting a sense for how many of my things -- books, furniture, clothing, habits, flatmate -- are not longer "current" for me... they are no longer really relevant to the mood, intentions, lifestyle, and modes of my life right now, or to the direction in which i wish my life to be moving right now. And in this sensing I am feeling how these objects and living habits are literally holding me back, somehow tethering me ever so subtley... they are like a reconfirmation of my old self... they are part of the web that creates identity, but this part of the web is no longer a part that is relevant to my current self... so there is incongruence, and drag... inefficiency, friction, weight, that i was hardly noticing, because it was there statically for so long, invisible because so habituated. 

And this theme reminds of the topic of [[Fresh]], and how it seems to be a "fact of life" that renewal and continued morphing and development is an integral part of a "healthy" and energetically flowing way of living. (Or am I simplifying or omitting exceptions to this? Or is this just a certain "dynamic" ideal image that I am positing, just one among other possible one?). This "fact of life" seems closely linked with the assertion that my psychologist never seems to tire to remind me of: "[[people change]]" (and "situations change"). I suppose the above thoughts might simply be understood as the application of the "people change" adage to oneself, one's own relationship to oneself and one's everyday surroundings, and one's own broader situations.
