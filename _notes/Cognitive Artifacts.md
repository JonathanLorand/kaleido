 "Cognitive artifacts are those artificial devices that maintain, display, or operate upon information in order to serve a representational function and that affect human cognitive performance"
	- Donald Norman
	
Examples: a calendar, a shopping list, a computer, a mnemonic poem, a symbol, a map, a wise saying or a rule of thumb.

#### Notes


I think I first heard of this term via my friend E.I. 

An interesting distinction, due, I think, to [David Krakauer](http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~krakauer/Site/Welcome.html): 

> **Complementary Cognitive Artifacts**: These are artifacts that complement human intelligence in such a way that their use amplifies and improves our ability to perform cognitive tasks _and_Â once the user has mastered the physical artifact they can use a virtual/mental equivalent to perform the same cognitive task at a similar level of skill, e.g. an abacus.

> **Competitive Cognitive Artifacts**: These are artifacts that amplify and improve our abilities to perform cognitive tasks when we have use of the artifact _but_ when we take away the artifact we are no better (and possibly worse) at performing the cognitive task than we were before.
