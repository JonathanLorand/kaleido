title: Co-constitution
---

Two interacting entities, A and B, through their interaction, may generate a third entity C - contingent on the interaction and emergent from it. We say in this case that A and B *co-constitute* C. 

Here "entities" has an ontological flavor. In some situations, where A and B are people, and C is an action of relating that is happening between them, it seems common that C is given an ontological weighting or status that is different from A and B. It seems an interesting perspective arises when comparing these ontological framings... what happens when we place A, B and C on an equal footing? 

Different ontological "weightings" or "statuses" seem associated with various kinds of aspects, such as:
- Is there a physical entity involved or not? in non-physical cases, is the entity arising conceptual? Does it feel dynamic/action-related or static?
- How long is the entity "the same" over a period of time? How much does it change or transform? With respect to which reference frame is such change measured?
- Some entities seem to be "dependent types" (in the sense of type theory): in the above situation, C depends on A and B. What are criteria or reasons why we might view certain entities as having an "independent type"? Is it related to such a thing as being "directly accessible to sense perception" (whatever that means)??

A further twist to the initial situation described above is the following. Let us imagine that the identity -- the entity-ness -- of A and B is dependent on C. Then, in addition to C being still in some sense dependent on A and B, we also have that A and B are dependent on C. It seems we are no longer in a situation where we have independent and dependent types arranged in a way that has directionality (e.g. building up from independent to depedent types), but we are in a 'circular' or 'co-dependent' situation. We might then think of this circular situation in terms of feedback  (in category theory terms, thus perhaps in terms of traces and in terms of fixed points). In this situation, does it make sense to think of A, B, and C, as separate entities at all? Might it be more fitting to think of the ensemble of A, B, and C as a total entity D, which has subcomponents A, B, and C which are in some sense distinguishable from each other but on the other hand not seperable or independent either? To describe such a situation we might now say that A and B *co-consitute each other* "through C". 

I imagine that this 'circularly co-dependent' situation is related to the term "intra-action" of Karen Barad, which I have heard of, though I have yet to read any of her texts.

#### Notes

In terms of category theory, "placing A, B and C on equal footing" reminds me of the concept of an "internal Hom". That is, "equal footing" is interpreted then as saying that A, B, and C are all objects of the same category, and "C", which encapsulated relations between A and B, plays the role of internal Hom. In general, Hom(A,B) has a directedness -- from A and to B -- but in certain cagetories, where morphisms has transposes, this directedness is only formal on might say. 

I'm wondering if there might be category-theoretic notion which captures a situation where A and B co-consitute each other. This smells a bit like perhaps some sort of universal property that describes/characterizes the interaction of A and B as a thing in itself and where the roles played by A and B are the essential feature, not their "identities" as objects of a given category.
