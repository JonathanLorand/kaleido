This is a portmanteau of "quiet" and "attitude". 

I think of it as a way of approaching things - thoughts, actions, objects, other people, oneself - with a gentless and sensitivity that is quiet. It feels anchored in oneself, it feels somehow opposite to "driven", it contains a certain openness to whatever unfolds and also to what happens with oneself, but in a way that has inertial weightedness, a groundedness, an absorbing capacity. One is not a ping-pong ball (which is hard and springy and jumpy). One is soft and mossy, and... I almost want to say "stone", but actually one is also light, able to shift and be light-hearted and funny, at least on the surface (and not "superficially" on the surface, in the negative sense of the word). At the same time there is a compfyness (like a sofa?). Is it the comfyness of "true" confidence that one emulates/lives for while? The vulnerable, not-knowing confidence? One that is backed-up by a certain self-acceptance? It seems I've named a lot of characteristics. I wonder if there are images or metaphors (like the ping-pong ball) that fit what I am imagining here. 

As an anectdote, I distinctly remember being in this attitude of quietude on a day many years ago when I when to the box on stilts in Wiedikon for a tango practica, and upon arriving there was Jeffrey Wolf, and I interacted/conversed with him from this energy (which felt also very good). He made a comment about how 'sympathisch' I was, and this struck me and this scene has stayed with me.
