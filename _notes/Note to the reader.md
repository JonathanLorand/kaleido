Apologies: these notes are mainly written for me.  
I'm note sure how intelligeable or interesting they might be for you. Perhaps a little bit in one way or another. 

They may grow/change/shift over time. 

One thing I discovered and like, and wish to develop in the future, is the idea of making "constellations". Juxtaposing and combining together the topics of various notes gets me stimulated, and new connections and ideas emerge. At the moment, the constellation notes are just a list of other notes that I have  grouped together. In the future, the intention is to also write notes about these groupings, i.e. turn the constellation notes into actual notes.
