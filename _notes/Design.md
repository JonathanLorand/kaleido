#### Notes

"To design is to devise courses of action aimed at changing existing situations into preferred ones."
	- Herbert Simon
	
"Design is the first signal of human intention. This concept makes us ask questions: Are we intentionally designing buildings, products, and systems that put billions of pounds of hazardous material in the soil, the air, and the water every year? Why would anybody do that on purpose? And yet, that’s what we have. Would we intentionally use forms of energy that have the potential to cause immense destruction to planetary systems and economies? Would we do things that aren’t fair to people?"
	- William MacDonough
