A (perhaps) simplistic and (perhaps) useful abstract model: communication involves a sender S, a medium M, and a reciever R. These three enitites are understood operationally in terms of their roles. In particular, in a given situation, a specific person might be both the sender and the reciever. For example, I might play the role of both S and R when I communicate with myself through the medium of speaking out loud, or when I communicate with myself thought the medium of written notes. 

"Time and space", "context", and "interpretation" also seem to be relevant basic terms when thinking about communication abstractly. I feel unsure though if these are the "right" terms?? What all might they describe? How do they fit into the simple three-part model above?

Aspects seem to be, for example, the questions of what ("further"?) information is available to the sender and/or the reciever, and where and when, and how this effects interpretation. And what are the processes by which "interpretation" happens? 
Also: what are spatial and temporal aspects of the medium? For example, when and how can information be accessed?
