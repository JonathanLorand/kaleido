There is a certain way of seeing in which nearly any activity can be holy and rich. 

There seems to be a component of love, and also a component of distance: seeing the whole scene from an outside perspective. Seeing oneself in the scene. Seeing the chore in the scene. Seeing the broader landscape of life in the scene. And seeing also the "abysses of time and meaning and mystery" at the fringes of this landscape. 
At the same time as holding this macroscopic view, there is, in parallel, an entering in into the sensual experience of the now. The feelings one is having, the dynamics of ones thoughts, the sensory impulses of the body connected with the activitiy at hand. 
Furthermore, in addition to percieveing one's own percieving, there is a heightened attention to the activity and the objects/people one is dealing with. One is listening to them, observing them, caring for them, in a dialogue with them. 
So it seems there are three levels that I've described. I think there is the element of love at all three of these levels. I wonder if it's flavor is different in each case. It seems there might be some subtle differences, based on how I imagine this whole complex of feelings. Perhaps the love is the same energy, but takes a different form because in each case it is interaction with a different other? 

I wonder if this sounds very 'holy' in a way that might put a person off. I wonder what are things that might be off-putting. I have this doubt rising up in me, but I'm not sure what it is pointing to precisely. Perhaps the thing that I might not like is a feeling of holiness that is prescriptive, that says that there is a 'good' (read: 'correct') way of doing a task, going through life, etc. This seems narrowing and restrictive; authoritarian. It might live in a space of "do" and "don't", which feels like rules rather than... what is a positive alternative way of phrasing? Perhaps: an invitation to share a treasure? Hafiz comes to mind just now, at least in the translations of Daniel Ladinsky: as a flirty, playful, romantic, enthusiastic lover of life and what he calls "God". 

I think such ecstatic poetry is a good point of reference to orient here. But it is a potent energy that is different than the one here. The one here is calmer, more grounded, loving and positive (in which sense, this word?) but also tough, in the sense of being able to endure hardship. Slightly bittersweet too, it feels, perhaps because it welcomes in (or doesn't exclude, say) the absurdity and tragedy which is visible when the macroscopic landscape of life is kept also in view.
