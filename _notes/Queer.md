"a process of trying to put into practice a set of ethical modes of engagement with sexual and gender difference"

This is taken from this definition of the word "queer" that spoke to me: 

>"Before I go any further, I should make clear that ‘queer’, as I am using it here, is more than simply an umbrella term for all those who are ‘othered’ by normative heterosexuality. It is more than a synonym for any of the variety of acronyms made up from identity categories (e.g. ‘LGBT’). Indeed, ‘queer’, in many of the spaces I am thinking about, is as opposed to homonormativity as it is to heteronormativity. Queer opposes and contests the complacent politics of mainstream gay politicians who actively work to win gay people’s compliance with a depoliticised culture based on domesticity and privatised consumption. Queer celebrates gender and sexual fluidity and consciously blurs binaries. It is more of a process of trying to put into practice a set of ethical modes of engagement with sexual and gender difference than a simple identity category. As Jamie Heckert (2004) has suggested, a truly radical politics of sexuality must move beyond simple transgression and incorporate its ethical goals (for example co-operative, non-hierarchical, sex-positive relationships) into its mode of operation. The queer autonomous spaces that I discuss in this chapter are attempts to create room for these ethics to be put into practice – indeed, in finding ways of creating these spaces, participants are engaged in a process of putting such ethics into practice. In their recent attempts to theorise the geographies of a range of experiments in social autonomy (e.g. social centres, convergence spaces and intentional communities), Jenny Pickerill and Paul Chatterton have articulated that these are ‘spaces where people desire to constitute non-capitalist, egalitarian and solidaristic forms of political, social and economic organization through a combination of resistance and creation’ (Pickerill and Chatterton 2006:730)."

This is quoted from a chapter ("Amateurism and anarchism in the creation of autonomous queer spaces") written by Gavin Brown, in the book "Anarchism and Sexuality", edited by Jamie Heckert and Richard Cleminson. Came to me iva my friend M.H.
