What is a paradigm anyway?

Dunno, not really sure. 
Do I know one when I see one? 
Maybe. Probly. 

Anyway, I'll talk about paradigms as if they're a thing. I'm thinking of paradigms as something that isn't total or all-encompassing (otherwise that'd be maybe something called a "worldview" or a "theory of everything" or a "culture" or a "mythology".)  So somehow paradigms have a certain "scope", a certain range of subjects and contexts which they are used for thinking about and within. And of course it plays a role *who* is using the paradigm. 

Sometimes one might have multiple paradigms through which one views a single given subject matter. And sometimes one uses different paradigms for different topics or contexts. The scope of paradigms might overlap, and paradigms themselves might also overlap. 

It seems I'm talking as if there were two layers here: the landscape of "subject-matter" and another "landscape of paradigms". This is perhaps a false seperation, but one I guess I'll stick with for now. Where is the seperationg coming from? Perhaps from the fact that there is a certain seperation in terms of "roles" of how I'm thinking about paradigms: in my current imagined conceptual scene, there seems to be an "agent" (i.e. a person), a "paradigm", and "subject-matter". The paradigm is being cast as a tool or a lense or a medium, and the subject matter plays the role of the object, or the content. The mental metaphor I have is that paradigms are like maps, and subject matter is landscapes. Maps can overlap. All maps are wrong. Having multiple different maps for the same territory can be useful. 

In mathematics, a basic idea is that of a coordinate system. Often coordinate systems are thought of as maps. Coordinate systems are frames of reference, with the help of which one can name and determine the relative positions of objects in the terrain covered by the coordinate system. The idea of a "manifold" in mathematics is that it is a space, a landscape, that *locally* can be described via coordinate systems, even though "globally", in totality, it might not admit a description via one single coordinate system. And although a single global coodinate system might not exist, one does assume that there are enought local coordinate systems to cover all the local regions of the manifold, and that furthermore these local maps can be patched together coherently to build what is called an "atlas". An atlas is a patchwork of maps. The maps may each be limited, but we have more than just a flurry of maps that covers the landscape: we have a coherent way to transition from one to the next. They are stitched together. 

So I guess that's what I'm thinking of with the term "paradigm patchworking". Or asking, perhaps. 

What are the ways to stitch together paradigms? To transition from one to the next? To combine them constructively to an atlas, without tearing the individual maps?
